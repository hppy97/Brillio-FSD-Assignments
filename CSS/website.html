          <h2>Fiction</h2>
        <p>Fiction books contain a made-up story â€“ a story that did not actually happen in real life. 
        These stories are derived from the imagination and creativity of the authors and are not based on facts.</p> 
    <p><b>The Alchemist</b> by Paulo Coelho, 1984 by George Orwell, <b>Harry Potter 
        Series</b> by J. K. Rowling are some of the examples of fiction books.</p>
